## Description

This 1.54" e-Paper Module features a 200×200 pixel resolution display with excellent readability under direct sunlight and ultra-low power consumption. The e-paper technology provides a paper-like visual experience with no backlight required and the ability to maintain displayed content indefinitely without power.

The module uses an embedded controller and communicates via SPI interface, supporting both full and partial refresh modes. Due to its advantages like ultra-low power consumption, wide viewing angle, and great visibility under sunlight, it's ideal for applications such as shelf labels, industrial instruments, IoT displays, and battery-powered projects.
