## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these DPDT toggle switches:

- **Guitar Electronics**: Pickup switching, coil tapping, series/parallel wiring
- **Audio Equipment**: Signal routing, channel selection, effect switching
- **Electronics Projects**: Dual circuit control, polarity switching
- **Control Panels**: Equipment mode selection, function switching
- **Power Switching**: Dual power source selection, backup switching
- **Motor Control**: Direction control, speed selection
- **Test Equipment**: Signal routing, measurement switching
- **Amplifiers**: Input selection, gain switching, tone control
- **Radio Equipment**: Antenna switching, band selection
- **Lighting Control**: Multi-way switching, scene selection

## Wiring Configuration

### Terminal Layout (6-Pin DPDT)
```
Terminal 1    Terminal 4
    |             |
Terminal 2    Terminal 5  (Common/Pole terminals)
    |             |
Terminal 3    Terminal 6
```

### Common Wiring Examples
- **Guitar Pickup Switching**: Common = pickup output, positions = different pickup combinations
- **Audio Signal Routing**: Common = input signal, positions = different output destinations
- **Polarity Switching**: Common = power input, positions = normal/reversed polarity
- **Dual Circuit Control**: Independent switching of two separate circuits

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- DPDT configuration allows independent switching of two circuits
- ON/ON operation means no center-off position
- Suitable for both AC and DC applications within ratings
- Solder lug terminals provide secure connections
- Compact size ideal for space-constrained applications
- Professional appearance suitable for front panel mounting
- Quality construction ensures reliable operation

## Installation

- Drill 5.8mm (0.23") hole in panel
- Insert switch through hole from front
- Secure with included nut and washers from rear
- Solder wires to appropriate terminals based on application
- Test switch operation before final installation
- Label switch positions if needed for user interface

## Safety Considerations

- **Voltage Rating**: Never exceed 125V AC or equivalent DC
- **Current Rating**: Do not exceed 6A per pole
- **Proper Wiring**: Ensure correct terminal connections for intended operation
- **Panel Mounting**: Secure mounting prevents mechanical stress on terminals
- **Wire Gauge**: Use appropriate wire gauge for current load

## Guitar Electronics Applications

These switches are particularly popular in guitar modifications:

- **Pickup Selection**: Switch between different pickup combinations
- **Coil Tapping**: Switch between humbucker and single-coil modes
- **Series/Parallel**: Change pickup wiring configuration
- **Phase Switching**: Reverse pickup phase for tonal variations
- **Kill Switch**: Momentary signal interruption (with modification)
