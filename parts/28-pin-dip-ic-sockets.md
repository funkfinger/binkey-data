## Installation Guidelines

### PCB Design Considerations
```
Footprint Requirements:
- Pin spacing: 0.100" (2.54mm)
- Row spacing: 0.600" (15.24mm)
- Hole diameter: 0.038" - 0.042" typical
- Pad diameter: 0.060" - 0.070" typical
- Silkscreen outline recommended for proper orientation
```

### Soldering Instructions
```
1. Insert socket into PCB with pin 1 indicator aligned
2. Ensure socket sits flush against PCB surface
3. Solder all pins with appropriate temperature (300-350°C)
4. Use flux for clean, reliable solder joints
5. Inspect for cold solder joints or bridges
6. Clean flux residue if required
```

### IC Insertion Best Practices
```
1. Verify IC orientation (pin 1 alignment)
2. Check IC pin straightness before insertion
3. Insert IC gently with even pressure
4. Ensure all pins are properly seated
5. Avoid excessive force during insertion
6. Use IC extraction tool for removal when needed
```

## Design Considerations

### Socket Selection
- **Contact Material**: Choose gold-plated contacts for critical applications
- **Profile Height**: Consider clearance requirements above PCB
- **Insertion Force**: Low insertion force sockets for frequent IC changes
- **Temperature Rating**: Match socket rating to application requirements

### PCB Layout
- **Orientation Marking**: Clear pin 1 indication on silkscreen
- **Clearance**: Adequate space around socket for IC insertion/removal
