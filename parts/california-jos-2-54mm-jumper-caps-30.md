**Visual Description**: These jumper caps appear as small black plastic rectangular blocks with internal metal contacts. They are designed to slide over two adjacent pins on a 2.54mm pitch pin header, creating an electrical bridge between the pins. The black plastic housing provides insulation and mechanical protection for the internal contacts.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Circuit board configuration jumpers
- Enable/disable function selection
- Development board option settings
- Prototype circuit connections
- Production electronics configuration
- Arduino and microcontroller projects
- PCB testing and debugging
- Signal routing and switching
- Hardware configuration selection
- Educational electronics projects

## Configuration Examples

### Common Jumper Applications:

- **Power Selection**: Choose between 3.3V or 5V operation
- **Clock Source**: Select internal or external clock
- **Boot Mode**: Configure boot from flash or bootloader
- **Interface Selection**: Choose UART, SPI, or I2C communication
- **Feature Enable**: Enable or disable specific circuit functions

### Installation Patterns:

- **Single Jumper**: Connect two adjacent pins
- **Multiple Jumpers**: Configure multiple options simultaneously
- **Temporary Connections**: Easy removal for testing different configurations
- **Permanent Settings**: Long-term configuration in production units

## Installation Instructions

### Basic Installation:

1. **Pin Header Verification**: Ensure pin header has 2.54mm pitch spacing
2. **Jumper Placement**: Align jumper cap with desired pin pair
3. **Connection**: Press jumper cap firmly onto pins until seated
4. **Verification**: Check that jumper is fully seated and secure
5. **Testing**: Verify electrical continuity if needed

### Removal and Replacement:

1. **Gentle Removal**: Use small pliers or fingers to pull jumper straight up
2. **Avoid Side Forces**: Pull directly upward to prevent pin damage
3. **Repositioning**: Move to different pin pairs as needed for configuration
4. **Storage**: Keep unused jumpers organized for future use

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Pin Compatibility**: Designed for standard 0.025" square pins
- **Contact Pressure**: Friction fit provides reliable electrical contact
- **Repeated Use**: Designed for multiple insertion/removal cycles
- **Current Limitations**: Verify current rating for specific applications
- **Environmental**: Suitable for indoor electronics applications
- **Mechanical Stress**: Avoid excessive side forces during installation
- **Cleaning**: Clean contacts if connection becomes unreliable
- **Replacement**: Replace if plastic housing cracks or contacts wear
- **Documentation**: Label jumper positions for complex configurations
