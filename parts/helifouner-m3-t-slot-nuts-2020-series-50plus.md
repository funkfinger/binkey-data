- **Price Range**: $10-15
- **Product URL**: https://a.co/d/gK2f03d

## Description

These HELIFOUNER M3 T-slot nuts are specifically designed for use with 2020 series aluminum extrusion profiles (20mm x 20mm cross-section). These sliding nuts fit into the T-slot channels of aluminum profiles to provide secure threaded anchor points for M3 screws and bolts. Made from steel or zinc-plated steel for strength and corrosion resistance, these T-nuts are essential components for modular framing systems, 3D printer construction, CNC machine builds, and industrial automation applications. The sliding design allows for easy positioning and adjustment within the aluminum profile slots.

## Specifications

### Thread Specifications

- **Thread Size**: M3 (3mm nominal diameter)
- **Thread Pitch**: 0.5mm (standard coarse pitch for M3)
- **Thread Standard**: ISO metric thread
- **Thread Class**: Typically 6H for nuts

### T-Slot Compatibility

- **Profile Series**: 2020 series aluminum extrusion
- **Profile Dimensions**: 20mm x 20mm cross-section
- **Slot Width**: Compatible with standard 2020 T-slot dimensions
- **Sliding Action**: Designed to slide freely within T-slot channels

### Construction Details

- **Material**: Steel or zinc-plated steel construction
- **Finish**: Typically zinc-plated for corrosion resistance
- **Design**: T-shaped profile for secure retention in aluminum slots
- **Installation**: Slides into T-slot channel from the end or through slot opening

**Visual Description**: These T-slot nuts have a distinctive T-shaped profile with a threaded center section. The T-shaped flanges are designed to fit securely within the T-slot channels of 2020 aluminum profiles, while the central threaded portion accepts M3 screws. The steel construction typically has a zinc-plated finish for corrosion resistance.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

### 3D Printer Construction:
- Frame assembly for RepRap and custom 3D printers
- Bed mounting and adjustment mechanisms
- Extruder and hotend mounting systems
- Enclosure construction

### CNC Machine Building:
- Machine frame construction
- Spoilboard mounting systems
- Tool holder and accessory mounting
- Enclosure and safety barrier assembly

### Industrial Automation:
- Conveyor system construction
- Machine guarding and safety barriers
- Workstation and fixture assembly
- Modular equipment mounting

### General Applications:
- Modular shelving and storage systems
- Workbench and table construction
- Display and exhibition frameworks
- Educational and prototyping projects

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Profile Preparation**: Ensure aluminum profile T-slots are clean and free of debris
2. **Nut Insertion**: Slide T-nut into T-slot channel from end or through slot opening
3. **Positioning**: Position T-nut at desired location within the slot
4. **Screw Installation**: Insert M3 screw through component and into T-nut
5. **Tightening**: Tighten screw to secure component and lock T-nut in position

### Best Practices:

- Use appropriate M3 screw length for total assembly thickness
- Don't over-tighten to avoid stripping threads or damaging aluminum profile
- Consider using washers to distribute load over larger area
- Pre-position T-nuts before final assembly when possible
- Keep spare T-nuts accessible for modifications and additions

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Slot Compatibility**: Designed specifically for 2020 series aluminum profiles
- **Load Capacity**: Suitable for moderate loads typical of modular framing applications
- **Corrosion Resistance**: Zinc plating provides protection in most environments
- **Thread Engagement**: Ensure adequate thread engagement for secure connection
- **Sliding Action**: T-nuts can slide within slots for easy positioning and adjustment
- **Profile Orientation**: Works with T-slots in any orientation (horizontal, vertical, angled)
- **Modification Friendly**: Easy to reposition or remove for system modifications
- **Tool Requirements**: Standard M3 hex key or screwdriver for installation
