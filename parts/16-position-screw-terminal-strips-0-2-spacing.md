## Image

_Image needed: 16-position terminal strip showing dual-level wire entry and mounting options._

**Visual Description**: This terminal strip appears as a long, narrow block with 16 individual screw terminals arranged in a single row. The green or gray housing shows clear separation between each terminal position, with screws visible for wire clamping. Mounting holes or DIN rail clips are visible on the sides, and the dual-level design allows wires to enter from both top and bottom.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Industrial control panel wiring
- Power distribution blocks
- Signal distribution and splitting
- Motor control center connections
- PLC input/output wiring
- Lighting control systems
- HVAC control panels
- Process control interfaces
- Test and measurement setups
- Automation system interconnections

## Wiring Examples

### Power Distribution

```
Terminal Strip Layout (16 positions):
Positions 1-4:   AC Input Distribution (L1, L2, L3, N)
Positions 5-8:   DC Power Rails (+24V, +12V, +5V, GND)
Positions 9-12:  Control Signals (Start, Stop, Reset, Alarm)
Positions 13-16: Status Outputs (Run, Fault, Ready, Spare)
```

### Signal Distribution

```
Common Signal Distribution:
- Input signal to position 1
- Jumper connections to distribute to multiple outputs
- Each output position connects to different devices
- Maintains signal integrity across all connections
```

## Installation Instructions

### Panel Mounting:

1. **Layout Planning**: Plan terminal strip placement for optimal wire routing
2. **Mounting**: Secure to panel using mounting screws or DIN rail clips
3. **Spacing**: Allow adequate clearance for wire bending and access
4. **Labeling**: Label terminal positions for maintenance

### Wire Connections:

1. **Wire Preparation**: Strip wire ends 6-8mm (1/4 inch)
2. **Terminal Access**: Loosen screw to open clamp mechanism
3. **Wire Insertion**: Insert stripped wire fully into terminal opening
4. **Securing**: Tighten screw to manufacturer's torque specification
5. **Verification**: Perform pull test to verify secure connection

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Current Derating**: Consider derating for bundled wires or high temperatures
- **Wire Management**: Plan wire routing to avoid stress on terminals
- **Torque Specifications**: Use proper torque to avoid over-tightening
- **Maintenance Access**: Ensure terminals remain accessible for service
- **Jumper Connections**: Use appropriate jumper wires for distribution
- **Environmental**: Consider IP rating requirements for enclosure
- **Expansion**: Modular design allows for easy system expansion
- **Documentation**: Maintain wiring diagrams for complex installations

## Notes

These 16-position terminal strips are excellent for complex wiring applications requiring high-density connections in a compact space. The 0.2" spacing provides good balance between connection density and wire management accessibility. Having 6 pieces allows for substantial wiring projects or provides consistency across multiple control panels. The dual-level wire entry design offers maximum flexibility for complex wiring layouts. Perfect for industrial control applications, power distribution, and any project where multiple secure wire connections are needed in an organized, serviceable format. The modular nature allows for easy expansion as system requirements grow.
