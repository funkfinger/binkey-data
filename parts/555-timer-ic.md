## Pinout Diagram

### Pin Descriptions (8-DIP Package)

| Pin | Name | Function |
|-----|------|----------|
| 1 | GND | Ground |
| 2 | TRIGGER | Trigger input (active low) |
| 3 | OUTPUT | Timer output |
| 4 | RESET | Reset input (active low) |
| 5 | CONTROL | Control voltage input |
| 6 | THRESHOLD | Threshold input |
| 7 | DISCHARGE | Open collector discharge output |
| 8 | VCC | Positive power supply |

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for this component:
- LED flashers and blinkers
- Pulse width modulation (PWM) circuits
- Tone generators and buzzers
- Delay circuits and timers
- Clock generators for digital circuits
- Voltage controlled oscillators (VCO)
- Missing pulse detectors
- Sequential timing circuits

## Circuit Examples

### Astable Multivibrator (Oscillator)
```
VCC (Pin 8) ---- +5V to +15V
GND (Pin 1) ---- Ground
RESET (Pin 4) -- VCC (or control input)
CONTROL (Pin 5) - 0.01µF capacitor to ground
TRIGGER (Pin 2) - Connected to THRESHOLD (Pin 6)
THRESHOLD (Pin 6) - R1+R2 to VCC, timing capacitor to ground
DISCHARGE (Pin 7) - R2 to THRESHOLD
OUTPUT (Pin 3) -- Output signal

Frequency = 1.44 / ((R1 + 2*R2) * C)
```

### Monostable Multivibrator (One-Shot)
```
VCC (Pin 8) ---- +5V to +15V
GND (Pin 1) ---- Ground
RESET (Pin 4) -- VCC
CONTROL (Pin 5) - 0.01µF capacitor to ground
TRIGGER (Pin 2) - Input trigger (active low)
THRESHOLD (Pin 6) - R1 to VCC, timing capacitor to ground
DISCHARGE (Pin 7) - Connected to THRESHOLD
OUTPUT (Pin 3) -- Output pulse

Pulse Width = 1.1 * R1 * C
```

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and features:
- Use 0.01µF bypass capacitor on CONTROL pin (Pin 5) for noise immunity
- RESET pin (Pin 4) should be tied to VCC if not used for control
- Output can source or sink up to 200mA, suitable for driving LEDs directly
- For precise timing, use 1% tolerance resistors and capacitors
- Timing components should be stable over temperature
- Maximum frequency limited by propagation delays (~500kHz)
- DISCHARGE pin provides path to discharge timing capacitor
- TRIGGER and THRESHOLD inputs have hysteresis for noise immunity
