## Circuit Examples

### Basic Usage Circuit

```
Input Power Source (+) -----> VIN+ (Module Input)
Input Power Source (-) -----> VIN- (Module Input)

Module VOUT+ -----> Load (+)
Module VOUT- -----> Load (-)
```

### With Input/Output Capacitors (Recommended)

```
Input (+) ----[1000µF]---- VIN+ -----> LM2596 Module -----> VOUT+ ----[470µF]---- Load (+)
Input (-) ----------------  VIN- -----------------------> VOUT- --------------- Load (-)
```

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage notes:

- Minimum voltage difference of ~1.5V required between input and output
- For currents above 2A, additional heatsinking is required
- Input capacitor (1000µF) recommended for stable operation
- Output capacitor (470µF) recommended to reduce output ripple
- Adjust output voltage with small screwdriver on potentiometer
- Module generates less heat than linear regulators due to switching design
- Not suitable for noise-sensitive applications without additional filtering

## Notes

This is part of a 10-pack purchase, with 9 units currently in inventory (3 in Section A, 6 in Section B of Bin 14). These modules are extremely versatile and commonly used in electronics projects. The LM2596 is a proven, reliable switching regulator IC that's been widely used for decades.

The modules are particularly useful for converting higher voltage power supplies (like 12V wall adapters) down to the 5V or 3.3V levels commonly needed by microcontrollers and development boards. The high efficiency means less heat generation compared to linear regulators, making them suitable for higher power applications.

Quality can vary between manufacturers, but these DEVMO modules appear to be well-constructed with proper component selection for reliable operation.
