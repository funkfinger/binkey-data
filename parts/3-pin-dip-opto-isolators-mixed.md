# 3-Pin DIP Opto-Isolators (Mixed Collection)

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-3, Bin 37, Section D
- **Category**: Isolators
- **Brand**: Various
- **Part Number**: Mixed collection
- **Package**: 3-DIP
- **Quantity**: 14
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $0.20-1.00 (estimated)

## Description

This is a mixed collection of 14 various 3-pin DIP opto-isolators from different manufacturers. These components provide electrical isolation between input and output circuits using optical coupling. The 3-pin configuration typically consists of an anode, cathode for the input LED, and a single output pin (usually a phototransistor collector or photodiode). These are useful for basic isolation applications where a simple on/off signal needs to be transmitted across an isolation barrier.

## Specifications

## Technical Notes

Important considerations for 3-pin opto-isolators:
- **Current Limiting**: Always use appropriate current limiting resistors for the input LED
- **Pull-up Resistors**: Output may require pull-up resistor depending on configuration
- **Mixed Collection**: Since these are various models, check individual specifications before use
- **Isolation Rating**: Verify isolation voltage rating for your specific application
- **Output Type**: May be phototransistor, photodiode, or other photodetector types

## Notes

This mixed collection of 3-pin DIP opto-isolators provides flexibility for various isolation applications. Since these are from different manufacturers and potentially different models, it's recommended to test each component individually to determine its specific characteristics before use in critical applications. The 3-pin configuration makes them simpler to use than 4-pin variants but may require external pull-up resistors depending on the output stage design. These components are excellent for learning about optical isolation principles and for prototyping isolation circuits.
