# M3 Hex Head Cap Screws - Short to Medium Lengths (5-15mm)

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-5, Bin 57
- **Category**: Hardware & Fasteners
- **Brand**: Various manufacturers
- **Model**: M3 Hex Head Cap Screws - Short to Medium Lengths (5-15mm)
- **Thread Size**: M3 (3mm nominal diameter)
- **Package**: Assorted lengths (5-15mm)
- **Quantity**: Various M3 hex head screws
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $8-18

## Description

This collection contains various M3 hex head cap screws in short to medium lengths, specifically ranging from 5-15mm. These compact fasteners are ideal for electronics assembly, circuit board mounting, and applications where space is limited but reliable fastening is required. The M3 thread size (3mm nominal diameter) with standard 0.5mm pitch provides excellent holding power for small to medium assemblies. The hex socket cap head design allows for precise torque control and provides a clean, low-profile appearance in finished assemblies.

## Specifications

### Thread Specifications

- **Thread Size**: M3 (3mm nominal diameter)
- **Thread Pitch**: 0.5mm (standard coarse pitch for M3)
- **Thread Standard**: ISO metric thread
- **Thread Class**: Typically 6g for screws

### Screw Specifications

- **Head Type**: Hex socket cap head (cylindrical head)
- **Drive Type**: Internal hex socket (Allen key)
- **Head Style**: Low-profile cylindrical design
- **Standard**: Typically ISO 4762 or DIN 912
- **Lengths**: Various lengths from 5mm to 15mm
- **Material**: Steel or stainless steel construction
- **Finish**: Plain steel, zinc-plated, or stainless steel

### Length Range Details

- **5-6mm**: Ultra-short for thin materials and minimal protrusion
- **8-10mm**: Short length for standard electronics assembly
- **12-15mm**: Medium length for moderate thickness assemblies

**Visual Description**: The collection contains cylindrical-headed screws with internal hex sockets in various short to medium lengths. The compact sizes are clearly visible, demonstrating their suitability for electronics and space-constrained applications where longer screws would be impractical.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

### Electronics Assembly:
- Circuit board mounting and spacing
- Component attachment and securing
- Enclosure assembly and panel mounting
- Heat sink and cooling system installation
- Connector and interface mounting

### Compact Assemblies:
- Small mechanical devices
- Precision instrument construction
- Miniature assemblies and fixtures
- Prototype and development work
- Educational electronics projects

### General Hardware:
- Appliance repair and assembly
- Furniture hardware and fixtures
- Automotive interior components
- Consumer electronics repair
- Hobby and maker projects

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Hole Preparation**: Ensure tapped holes are properly sized for M3 threads
2. **Length Selection**: Choose appropriate length for total assembly thickness
3. **Hex Key**: Use 2.5mm hex key for M3 cap screws
4. **Alignment**: Ensure screw is properly aligned before tightening
5. **Torque Control**: Apply appropriate torque to avoid over-tightening

### Best Practices:

- Use appropriate screw length: assembly thickness plus 2-3 threads minimum engagement
- Consider using washers for soft materials or large clearance holes
- Apply thread locker for permanent assemblies or vibration resistance
- Keep various lengths organized for easy selection
- Use proper hex key size to avoid stripping socket

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations:

- **Hex Key Size**: M3 cap screws use 2.5mm hex key (Allen key)
- **Thread Engagement**: Minimum 1.5x diameter (4.5mm) thread engagement recommended
- **Head Height**: Cap head adds approximately 3mm to overall assembly height
- **Socket Depth**: Ensure adequate clearance for hex key insertion
- **Material Selection**: Choose appropriate material for environment and load requirements
- **Length Calculation**: Total screw length should accommodate assembly thickness plus adequate thread engagement
- **Torque Specifications**: Typically 1.5-2.5 Nm for M3 cap screws (varies by material)
- **Clearance**: Ensure adequate clearance around screw head for installation access

## Notes

These M3 hex head cap screws in 5-15mm lengths provide essential fastening solutions for electronics assembly and compact mechanical applications. The short to medium length range makes them perfect for circuit boards, small enclosures, and applications where longer screws would be impractical or create unwanted protrusion. Having various lengths from 5-15mm ensures the right size is available for most electronics and small assembly projects. This collection complements the existing longer M3 screws in Bins 49 and 50, providing comprehensive coverage of M3 fastening needs from ultra-short to extended lengths. Essential for electronics enthusiasts, makers, and anyone working on compact assemblies requiring reliable, professional-grade metric fasteners.
