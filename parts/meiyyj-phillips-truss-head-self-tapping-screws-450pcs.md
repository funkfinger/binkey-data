## Description

This comprehensive 450-piece assortment contains Phillips truss head self-tapping screws in three metric sizes: M2.3, M2.6, and M3. These screws feature a distinctive truss head design (also called pan head with washer) that provides a large bearing surface for distributing load across thin materials. The self-tapping design allows these screws to create their own threads as they're driven into materials like sheet metal, plastic, and electronics enclosures. Made from carbon steel with appropriate surface treatment, these screws are ideal for electronics assembly, sheet metal work, and applications requiring secure fastening in thin materials.

## Specifications

### Thread Sizes and Applications

#### M2.3 Screws:
- **Thread Diameter**: 2.3mm nominal
- **Thread Pitch**: Typically 0.4mm (fine pitch)
- **Applications**: Small electronics, delicate assemblies, thin sheet metal

#### M2.6 Screws:
- **Thread Diameter**: 2.6mm nominal  
- **Thread Pitch**: Typically 0.45mm
- **Applications**: Medium electronics, plastic assemblies, general sheet metal work

#### M3 Screws:
- **Thread Diameter**: 3.0mm nominal
- **Thread Pitch**: Typically 0.5mm (standard coarse pitch)
- **Applications**: Heavier assemblies, thicker materials, structural connections

### Head Design

- **Head Type**: Phillips truss head (pan head with integrated washer)
- **Drive Type**: Phillips cross-slot (#1 or #2 Phillips driver)
- **Head Profile**: Low-profile rounded design with wide bearing surface
- **Washer Effect**: Integrated washer design distributes load over larger area
- **Appearance**: Professional, finished look suitable for visible applications

### Construction Details

- **Material**: Carbon steel construction for strength and durability
- **Self-Tapping**: Sharp threads cut their own path into materials
- **Self-Drilling**: Some sizes may include self-drilling points
- **Surface Treatment**: Appropriate coating for corrosion resistance
- **Thread Form**: Aggressive thread design for secure grip in materials

**Visual Description**: The assortment contains screws with distinctive truss heads that appear as rounded, low-profile heads with integrated washer-like flanges. The Phillips cross-slots are clearly visible, and the various sizes (M2.3, M2.6, M3) show the progression in diameter. The self-tapping threads have a sharp, aggressive appearance designed to cut into materials.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

### Electronics Assembly:
- Computer case assembly
- Electronics enclosure mounting
- PCB mounting and standoffs
- Control panel assembly
- Device housing construction

### Sheet Metal Work:
- HVAC ductwork assembly
- Automotive body panels
- Appliance manufacturing
- Metal fabrication projects
- Thin gauge steel assemblies

### Plastic Applications:
- Plastic enclosure assembly
- Consumer product manufacturing
- Prototype assemblies
- Automotive interior components
- Electronic device housings

### General Applications:
- Furniture assembly
- Cabinet construction
- Sign making and mounting
- General repair work
- DIY projects requiring self-tapping fasteners

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Size Selection**: Choose appropriate screw size for material thickness and application
2. **Pilot Holes**: May require small pilot holes for harder materials
3. **Drive Selection**: Use appropriate Phillips screwdriver (#1 or #2)
4. **Alignment**: Ensure screw is perpendicular to surface
5. **Driving**: Apply steady pressure while turning to allow self-tapping action
6. **Torque Control**: Don't over-tighten to avoid stripping threads or damaging materials

### Material-Specific Guidelines:

#### Sheet Metal:
- Use appropriate size for metal thickness
- Consider pilot holes for thicker materials
- Ensure adequate edge distance to prevent tearing

#### Plastic:
- Use lower torque to prevent cracking
- Consider thermal expansion in temperature-varying environments
- May require pilot holes in harder plastics

#### Electronics:
- Use anti-static precautions
- Ensure proper grounding
- Consider vibration resistance requirements

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Thread Engagement**: Self-tapping screws create their own threads for secure grip
- **Load Distribution**: Truss head design spreads load over larger area than standard heads
- **Material Compatibility**: Suitable for metals, plastics, and composite materials
- **Torque Limitations**: Don't over-tighten to avoid thread stripping or material damage
- **Reusability**: Limited reusability due to self-tapping nature
- **Corrosion**: Carbon steel may require additional protection in corrosive environments
- **Temperature**: Consider thermal expansion/contraction in varying temperature applications
