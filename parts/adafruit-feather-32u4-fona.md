## Notes

**DISCONTINUED** - This board is no longer manufactured due to the shutdown of 2G networks in many countries. It was designed for cellular IoT projects requiring voice, SMS, and data connectivity. Required a 500mAh+ LiPoly battery for proper cellular operation due to high current spikes. The SIM800 module provided comprehensive cellular functionality but was limited to 2G networks which are being phased out globally.
