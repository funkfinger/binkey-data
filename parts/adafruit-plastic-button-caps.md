- **Height Clearance**: Consider 3mm additional height in enclosure design
- **Color Selection**: Choose colors that match functional requirements
- **Durability**: Plastic construction suitable for repeated use
- **Cleaning**: Caps can be removed for cleaning if necessary

## Installation

### Mounting Process
1. Verify tactile switch has 2.4mm square top
2. Align button cap with switch actuator
3. Press down firmly until cap snaps into place
4. Test button operation to ensure proper fit
5. Verify cap doesn't interfere with enclosure

### Removal Process
1. Gently pry cap from switch using small tool
2. Work around edges to release snap-fit
3. Avoid excessive force to prevent damage
4. Clean cap and switch if needed before reinstallation

## Design Considerations

### Enclosure Design
- **Clearance**: Provide adequate clearance for 8mm diameter caps
- **Height**: Account for 3mm additional height above switch
- **Spacing**: Ensure adequate spacing between adjacent buttons
- **Access**: Design openings for easy cap installation/removal

### User Interface Design
- **Color Coding**: Use consistent color scheme for similar functions
- **Spacing**: Provide adequate spacing for comfortable finger operation
- **Labeling**: Consider additional labeling if color coding isn't sufficient
- **Accessibility**: Ensure button size and spacing meet accessibility requirements

## PyGamer Compatibility

These caps were specifically designed for the Adafruit PyGamer:

- **Perfect Fit**: Designed to match PyGamer tactile switches
- **Color Options**: Multiple colors for customization
- **Gaming Feel**: Improved tactile feedback for gaming
