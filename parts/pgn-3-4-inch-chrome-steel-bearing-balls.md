# PGN 3/4 Inch (0.75") Precision Chrome Steel Bearing Balls G25

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-5, Bin 33
- **Category**: Mechanical Components
- **Brand**: PGN
- **Model**: 3/4 Inch (0.75") Precision Chrome Steel Bearing Balls G25
- **Package**: Set of 10 pieces
- **Quantity**: 10
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $15-20
- **Product URL**: https://a.co/d/dOrHYQe

## Description

These precision chrome steel bearing balls are manufactured from AISI 52100 chrome steel, providing exceptional durability and hardness for demanding applications. Each ball has an exact diameter of 3/4 inch (0.75" or 19.05mm) and meets G25 grade specifications, ensuring precise tolerance levels in sphericity and size accuracy. The smaller diameter compared to 1-inch balls makes them ideal for medium-sized bearing assemblies and applications where space is more constrained.

## Specifications

### Physical Characteristics

- **Diameter**: 3/4 inch (0.75" or 19.05mm) exactly
- **Material**: AISI 52100 Chrome Steel (high carbon chromium alloy steel)
- **Precision Grade**: G25 (moderate tolerance class for industrial applications)
- **Hardness**: Approximately HRC 60-66 (typical for AISI 52100)
- **Surface Finish**: Polished chrome steel surface
- **Weight**: Approximately 28 grams per ball
- **Quantity**: 10 pieces per set

### Material Properties

- **Steel Type**: AISI 52100 high carbon chromium bearing steel
- **Carbon Content**: ~1.0% carbon for hardness
- **Chromium Content**: ~1.5% chromium for corrosion resistance
- **Heat Treatment**: Through-hardened and tempered
- **Corrosion Resistance**: Good (chrome steel construction)
- **Wear Resistance**: Excellent for bearing applications

### Key Features

- Precision manufactured to G25 grade tolerances
- High carbon chromium steel construction
- Excellent sphericity and surface finish
- Suitable for medium-load bearing applications
- Consistent diameter across all balls in set
- Industrial-grade quality for professional use
- Compatible with standard 3/4-inch bearing races
- More pieces per set (10 vs 5) for larger projects

**Visual Description**: These precision bearing balls have a mirror-like polished chrome steel finish that reflects light uniformly. Each ball is perfectly spherical with no visible surface imperfections. The chrome steel material gives them a bright, metallic appearance. At 3/4 inch diameter, they are noticeably smaller than 1-inch balls but maintain the same high-quality finish and precision.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Medium-sized ball bearing assemblies
- Automotive bearing repairs and maintenance
- Small to medium industrial machinery bearings
- Custom bearing race applications
- Mechanical engineering prototypes
- Precision linear motion systems
- Workshop and hobby mechanical projects
- Educational mechanical engineering demonstrations
- Replacement balls for existing 3/4" bearings
- Custom machinery construction

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Grade G25**: Moderate precision grade suitable for most industrial applications
- **Size Advantage**: 3/4" diameter fits more applications than 1" balls
- **Quantity**: 10 pieces provide more flexibility for larger projects
- **Tolerance**: Exact tolerances depend on manufacturer specifications
- **Hardness**: HRC 60-66 typical for AISI 52100 steel
- **Load Capacity**: Good load capacity for medium-duty applications
- **Temperature Range**: Suitable for normal industrial temperature ranges
- **Lubrication**: Requires appropriate bearing grease or oil
- **Installation**: Handle with clean tools to avoid contamination
- **Storage**: Store in dry environment to prevent corrosion
- **Compatibility**: Verify race dimensions before installation
- **Safety**: Wear safety glasses when handling - balls can roll unexpectedly

## Notes

These PGN precision chrome steel bearing balls offer excellent value with 10 pieces in the 3/4-inch size. The smaller diameter makes them more versatile for a wider range of applications compared to larger bearing balls. The G25 grade ensures they meet industrial precision standards while remaining cost-effective. The AISI 52100 chrome steel construction provides reliable performance and long service life. Having 10 pieces makes them ideal for larger projects or provides plenty of spares for multiple applications. Perfect for mechanical projects, automotive repairs, and custom bearing assemblies where precision and reliability are important but extreme precision tolerances aren't required.
