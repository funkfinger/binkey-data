- Switching power supply component protection
- LED driver thermal management
- DC-DC converter heat sinking
- Linear regulator cooling applications
- High-power transistor thermal protection
- Electronics prototyping and development

## Installation Instructions

### Basic Installation:

1. **Component Preparation**: Ensure TO-220 component is properly mounted on PCB
2. **Insulator Placement**: Position insulating pad between component and heatsink
3. **Heatsink Alignment**: Align heatsink mounting hole with component mounting hole
4. **Hardware Assembly**: Insert M3 screw through heatsink, insulator, and component
5. **Secure Mounting**: Tighten screw with appropriate torque (avoid over-tightening)
6. **Thermal Interface**: Apply thermal compound if needed for optimal heat transfer

### Best Practices:

- Clean component surface before installation
- Use appropriate torque to avoid component damage
- Ensure proper electrical isolation with insulator pads
- Consider airflow direction for optimal cooling
- Check component temperature under load conditions
