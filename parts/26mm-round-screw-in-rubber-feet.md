# 26mm Round Screw-In Rubber Feet

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-5, Bin 37
- **Category**: Hardware & Fasteners
- **Brand**: Various manufacturers
- **Model**: 26mm Round Screw-In Rubber Feet
- **Package**: Individual pieces
- **Quantity**: 6
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $8-12

## Description

These 26mm diameter round rubber feet feature a threaded insert for secure screw-in mounting to equipment, furniture, and project enclosures. The larger 26mm size provides excellent stability and load distribution while the rubber construction offers superior vibration dampening and surface protection. The screw-in design ensures a permanent, secure attachment that won't come loose with use, making them ideal for heavy equipment or frequently moved items.

## Specifications

### Physical Characteristics

- **Diameter**: 26mm (1.02 inches)
- **Material**: Durable rubber compound
- **Mounting**: Threaded insert for screw attachment
- **Color**: Typically black rubber
- **Height**: Varies (typically 8-15mm depending on profile)
- **Thread**: Standard machine screw threads (M4, M5, or #8-32 typical)
- **Profile**: Round cylindrical or slightly tapered
- **Base**: Flat or slightly concave for stability

### Load Characteristics

- **Load Capacity**: High load capacity due to 26mm contact area
- **Contact Area**: ~531 square mm (26mm diameter circle)
- **Weight Distribution**: Excellent due to large diameter
- **Stability**: Superior stability for heavy equipment
- **Compression**: Minimal compression under normal loads
- **Durometer**: Medium to firm rubber for load bearing

### Key Features

- Secure screw-in mounting prevents loosening
- Large 26mm diameter for maximum stability
- Excellent vibration dampening properties

**Visual Description**: These rubber feet appear as black rubber cylinders with a 26mm diameter base. Each foot has a threaded metal insert visible in the center, designed to accept a machine screw for secure mounting. The rubber has a textured surface for grip and the overall profile is low and stable, ideal for heavy equipment applications.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Heavy electronics equipment feet
- Professional audio/video equipment
- Industrial machinery isolation
- Large project enclosures and cases
- Furniture and cabinet feet
- Workshop equipment stabilization
- Server rack and computer equipment
- Laboratory instrument feet
- Test equipment isolation
- Heavy-duty vibration dampening

## Installation Instructions

### Basic Installation:

1. **Hole Preparation**: Drill pilot hole sized for screw thread
2. **Screw Selection**: Choose appropriate length machine screw
3. **Positioning**: Mark desired locations for even weight distribution
4. **Mounting**: Insert screw through equipment and into rubber foot
5. **Tightening**: Tighten securely but avoid over-compression

### Screw Specifications:

- **Thread Types**: M4, M5, or #8-32 machine screws typical
- **Length**: Choose length to engage fully in threaded insert
- **Head Type**: Pan head or flat head depending on application
- **Material**: Stainless steel recommended for durability

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Load Distribution**: Space evenly for optimal weight distribution
- **Thread Engagement**: Ensure full thread engagement for security
- **Over-Tightening**: Avoid over-tightening which can damage rubber
- **Surface Compatibility**: Works on all smooth surfaces
- **Temperature Range**: Suitable for indoor use (-10°C to +60°C)
- **Replacement**: Individual replacement possible with standard screws
- **Maintenance**: Clean periodically to maintain grip
- **Storage**: Store in cool, dry place to prevent rubber degradation
- **Safety**: Verify load capacity for specific applications

## Notes

These 26mm round screw-in rubber feet are excellent for heavy-duty applications requiring secure mounting and superior stability. The large diameter provides excellent load distribution and the screw-in design ensures they won't come loose with use. Perfect for professional equipment, heavy project enclosures, and furniture where permanent, reliable feet are needed. The threaded insert design allows for easy replacement if needed while providing much more security than adhesive alternatives. Having 6 pieces provides enough for most equipment applications with spares available for future projects.
