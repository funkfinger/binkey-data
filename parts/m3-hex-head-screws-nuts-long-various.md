- **Model**: M3 Hex Head Cap Screws and Nuts - Long Lengths (20-30mm)
- **Thread Size**: M3 (3mm nominal diameter)
- **Package**: Assorted long lengths (20-30mm)
- **Quantity**: Various M3 hex head screws and nuts
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $10-20

## Description

This collection contains various M3 hex head cap screws and nuts in longer lengths, specifically ranging from 20-30mm. These extended-length fasteners are ideal for applications requiring deeper penetration through thick materials or multiple components. The M3 thread size (3mm nominal diameter) with standard 0.5mm pitch provides reliable fastening for mechanical assemblies, electronics enclosures, and projects requiring extended reach. The hex socket cap head design allows for precise torque control and provides a clean, professional appearance in finished assemblies.

**Visual Description**: The collection contains cylindrical-headed screws with internal hex sockets in various lengths from 20-30mm, paired with matching hexagonal nuts. The longer lengths are clearly visible, demonstrating their suitability for deep assemblies and thick material applications.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Deep electronics enclosure assembly
- Multi-layer mechanical assemblies
- Thick material fastening (wood, plastic, metal)
- Extended reach applications
- Prototype assemblies with spacers
- Industrial equipment assembly
- Automotive applications
- Furniture and cabinet construction
- Structural assemblies requiring extended penetration
- Repair applications where standard lengths are insufficient

## Length-Specific Applications

### 20mm Applications:
- Standard thick panel assemblies
- Electronics with heat sinks
- Multi-PCB assemblies
- Moderate depth applications

### 22-25mm Applications:
- Thick enclosure walls
- Multiple component stacking
- Industrial control panels
- Extended spacer applications

### 30mm Applications:
- Maximum depth assemblies
- Structural connections
- Heavy-duty mechanical assemblies
- Extended reach repairs

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Length Selection**: Choose appropriate screw length for total assembly thickness
2. **Clearance Calculation**: Ensure adequate thread engagement (minimum 1.5x diameter)
3. **Hole Preparation**: Drill appropriate clearance holes (3.2-3.4mm typical)
4. **Thread Preparation**: Tap threads if needed (M3x0.5 tap)
5. **Assembly**: Insert screw through all components
6. **Tightening**: Use appropriate hex key size (typically 2.5mm for M3)
7. **Torque Control**: Apply appropriate torque for material and application

### Best Practices:

- Calculate total assembly thickness before selecting length
- Allow for washers and spacers in length calculations
- Use thread locker for vibration-prone applications
- Consider material compatibility to prevent galvanic corrosion
- Don't over-tighten to avoid thread stripping
- Use appropriate hex key size to prevent socket stripping

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Hex Key Size**: M3 cap screws typically use 2.5mm hex key
- **Thread Engagement**: Minimum 1.5x diameter (4.5mm) thread engagement recommended
- **Length Calculation**: Total screw length should equal assembly thickness plus nut thickness plus 1-2mm
- **Load Capacity**: Longer screws may have reduced tensile strength compared to shorter ones
- **Buckling**: Consider column buckling for very long screws under compression
- **Material Selection**: Choose appropriate material for environment and load requirements
- **Preload**: Longer screws may require different torque specifications
- **Clearance**: Ensure adequate clearance for hex key access during installation

## Notes

These longer M3 hex head cap screws and nuts provide essential fastening solutions for applications requiring extended reach or deep penetration through thick materials. The 20-30mm length range covers most extended assembly needs while maintaining the precision and reliability of the M3 thread standard. Having various lengths ensures you'll have the right screw for deep assemblies, multi-component stacking, or repair situations where standard lengths are insufficient. The hex socket design provides precise torque control and professional appearance, making them ideal for both prototype work and finished assemblies requiring extended fastening solutions.
