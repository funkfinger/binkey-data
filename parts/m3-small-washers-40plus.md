# M3 Small Washers - 40+ Pieces

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-5, Bin 56, Section B
- **Category**: Hardware & Fasteners
- **Type**: M3 Small Washers
- **Size**: M3 (3.2mm inner diameter, ~7mm outer diameter)
- **Package**: Individual washers
- **Quantity**: 40+ pieces
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $3-8

## Description

These M3 small washers are essential hardware components designed to distribute load and protect surfaces in metric fastening applications. With a 3.2mm inner diameter to accommodate M3 screws and bolts, these washers provide a larger bearing surface to prevent damage to materials and ensure secure fastening. Made from steel or similar metal construction, they are suitable for electronics assembly, mechanical projects, and general hardware applications where M3 fasteners are used.

## Specifications

### Dimensional Specifications

- **Inner Diameter**: 3.2mm (clearance fit for M3 screws)
- **Outer Diameter**: Approximately 7mm (typical for small M3 washers)
- **Thickness**: Typically 0.5-0.8mm (standard washer thickness)
- **Material**: Steel or zinc-plated steel construction
- **Finish**: Plain steel or zinc-plated for corrosion resistance

### Compatibility

- **Thread Size**: M3 (3mm nominal screw diameter)
- **Screw Types**: M3 machine screws, cap head screws, hex head screws
- **Applications**: Electronics, mechanical assemblies, general hardware
- **Load Distribution**: Spreads fastener load over larger surface area

## Applications

Common use cases and applications:

### Electronics Assembly:
- Circuit board mounting with M3 standoffs
- Component mounting and spacing
- Enclosure assembly and panel mounting
- Heat sink and cooling system installation

### Mechanical Projects:
- General machine assembly
- Automotive and motorcycle applications
- Appliance repair and assembly
- Furniture and fixture mounting

### General Hardware:
- Load distribution for soft materials
- Surface protection from screw heads
- Preventing pull-through in thin materials
- Reducing stress concentration

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Surface Preparation**: Ensure mounting surface is clean and flat
2. **Washer Placement**: Place washer between screw head and surface
3. **Alignment**: Ensure washer is properly centered on fastener
4. **Tightening**: Tighten screw to appropriate torque specification
5. **Load Distribution**: Verify washer provides adequate bearing surface

### Best Practices:

- Use washers when fastening into soft materials (plastic, wood, thin metal)
- Consider washer thickness when calculating screw length requirements
- Use appropriate washer size for the application load requirements
- Replace damaged or deformed washers to maintain proper function
- Keep washers clean and free from debris for optimal performance

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations:

- **Load Distribution**: Increases bearing area to reduce stress concentration
- **Surface Protection**: Prevents damage from screw head contact
- **Material Compatibility**: Suitable for most common materials and applications
- **Corrosion Resistance**: Zinc-plated versions provide enhanced corrosion protection
- **Size Selection**: Small washers appropriate for light to moderate load applications
- **Installation**: Simple drop-on installation with M3 fasteners
- **Reusability**: Can typically be reused if not damaged or deformed
