**Visual Description**: The assortment contains cylindrical-headed screws with internal hex sockets and matching hexagonal nuts, all with a bright stainless steel finish. The screws have clean, precision-machined heads and threads, while the nuts show the characteristic 6-sided hexagonal shape. Various screw lengths are visible, demonstrating the assortment's versatility.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Electronics enclosure assembly
- 3D printer construction and maintenance
- Mechanical project assembly
- Prototype and maker projects
- Computer case modifications
- Robotics construction
- Precision instrument assembly
- Outdoor equipment (corrosion resistance needed)
- Marine applications
- General mechanical fastening

## Length Varieties (Typical)

### Common M3 Screw Lengths:
- **6mm**: Very short applications, thin materials
- **8mm**: Short assemblies, electronics
- **10mm**: Standard short length for many applications
- **12mm**: Medium length for typical assemblies
- **16mm**: Longer assemblies, thicker materials
- **20mm**: Extended length for deep assemblies
- **25mm**: Long assemblies, multiple components
- **30mm+**: Extended applications, thick assemblies

### Application by Length:
- **6-10mm**: Electronics, thin panels, PCB mounting
- **12-16mm**: Standard mechanical assemblies
- **20-25mm**: Thicker materials, multiple washers
- **30mm+**: Deep assemblies, extended reach applications

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Length Selection**: Choose appropriate screw length for application
2. **Hole Preparation**: Drill appropriate clearance holes (3.2-3.4mm typical)
3. **Thread Preparation**: Tap threads if needed (M3x0.5 tap)
4. **Assembly**: Insert screw through components
5. **Tightening**: Use appropriate hex key size (typically 2.5mm for M3)
6. **Torque**: Apply appropriate torque (avoid over-tightening stainless steel)

### Best Practices:

- Use appropriate hex key size to avoid stripping
- Apply anti-seize compound for dissimilar metals
- Don't over-tighten stainless steel fasteners
- Use washers to distribute load when needed
- Consider thread locker for vibration-prone applications

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Hex Key Size**: M3 cap screws typically use 2.5mm hex key
- **Torque Specifications**: Lower torque than alloy steel due to material properties
- **Galling**: Stainless steel can gall; use appropriate lubrication
- **Magnetic Properties**: 304 stainless is slightly magnetic when work-hardened
- **Temperature Range**: Suitable for wide temperature range applications
- **Chemical Compatibility**: Excellent resistance to most chemicals and environments
- **Thread Engagement**: Minimum 1.5x diameter thread engagement recommended
- **Preload**: Moderate preload capability compared to high-strength alloy steels
- **Replacement**: Keep assorted lengths for various repair and assembly needs
