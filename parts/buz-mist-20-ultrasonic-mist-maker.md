**Visual Description**: This ultrasonic mist maker appears as a small white ceramic disc approximately 20mm in diameter. It features a smooth ceramic surface for water contact and metal electrical contacts for connection to the driving circuit. The device is designed to be partially submerged in water to create ultrasonic vibrations that atomize water into fine mist.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for this component:

- Ultrasonic humidifiers and air purifiers
- Decorative fountain mist effects
- Aquarium and terrarium humidification
- Greenhouse humidity control
- Aromatherapy diffusers
- Pond and water feature enhancement
- Indoor plant care systems
- Air freshening and odor elimination
- Special effects for displays
- Laboratory humidity control

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- Requires ultrasonic driver circuit operating at 108 KHz
- Must be used with clean, distilled water for best performance
- Ceramic surface should be kept clean for optimal mist generation
- Water level must be maintained above the transducer surface
- Frequency stability is critical for consistent mist output
- Temperature changes can affect operating frequency
- Regular cleaning prevents mineral buildup on ceramic surface
- Driver circuit should provide proper impedance matching
- Not suitable for continuous operation without proper cooling
- Water quality affects mist output and device longevity
