# Square M2.5 Nuts for Slots - 50+ Pieces

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-5, Bin 56, Section D
- **Category**: Hardware & Fasteners
- **Type**: Square M2.5 Nuts for Slots
- **Thread Size**: M2.5 (2.5mm nominal diameter)
- **Package**: Individual square nuts
- **Quantity**: 50+ pieces
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $5-12

## Description

These square M2.5 nuts are specialized fasteners designed for slot mounting and small T-slot applications. The square profile prevents rotation within slots while providing M2.5 threaded attachment points for screws and bolts. These nuts are ideal for miniature assemblies, precision equipment, small electronics enclosures, and applications where space constraints require smaller hardware than standard M3 T-slot systems. Made from steel or brass construction, they provide reliable threaded connections in confined spaces.

## Specifications

### Thread Specifications

- **Thread Size**: M2.5 (2.5mm nominal diameter)
- **Thread Pitch**: 0.45mm (standard pitch for M2.5)
- **Thread Standard**: ISO metric thread
- **Thread Class**: Typically 6H for nuts

### Physical Dimensions

- **Profile**: Square cross-section for slot retention
- **Material**: Steel or brass construction
- **Finish**: Plain steel, zinc-plated, or brass finish
- **Size**: Compact dimensions suitable for small assemblies
- **Thickness**: Optimized for slot width compatibility

### Slot Compatibility

- **Design**: Square profile prevents rotation in slots
- **Retention**: Secure fit within slot channels
- **Installation**: Slides into slots or can be inserted through openings
- **Applications**: Small T-slot profiles, custom enclosures, precision equipment

## Applications

Common use cases and applications:

### Miniature Assemblies:
- Small electronics enclosures and housings
- Precision instrument construction
- Miniature mechanical assemblies
- Compact device mounting systems

### Electronics Applications:
- Small circuit board mounting
- Sensor and component mounting
- Miniature heat sink attachment
- Compact connector and interface mounting

### Precision Equipment:
- Optical equipment assembly
- Scientific instrument construction
- Measurement device mounting
- Laboratory equipment assembly

### Custom Fabrication:
- Small T-slot profile systems
- Miniature modular construction
- Prototype and development assemblies
- Educational and hobby projects

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Slot Preparation**: Ensure slot is clean and properly sized
2. **Nut Insertion**: Insert square nut into slot channel
3. **Positioning**: Position nut at desired mounting location
4. **Screw Installation**: Insert M2.5 screw through component
5. **Tightening**: Tighten screw to secure assembly and lock nut

### Best Practices:

- Use appropriate M2.5 screw length for total assembly thickness
- Avoid over-tightening small M2.5 threads to prevent stripping
- Ensure square nut is properly seated in slot before tightening
- Consider using threadlocker for permanent assemblies
- Keep spare nuts available for modifications and repairs

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations:

- **Small Size**: M2.5 is smaller than M3, requiring careful handling
- **Square Profile**: Prevents rotation and provides secure slot retention
- **Load Capacity**: Suitable for light to moderate loads in small assemblies
- **Material Selection**: Steel for strength, brass for corrosion resistance
- **Thread Engagement**: Ensure adequate thread engagement for secure connection
- **Slot Compatibility**: Designed for specific slot widths and profiles
- **Installation Tools**: Small hex keys or screwdrivers required for M2.5 screws
- **Precision**: Manufactured to tight tolerances for reliable fit and function
