### Audio Level Control
```cpp
// Arduino code for professional audio level control
const int levelPin = A0;
const int outputPin = 9;

void setup() {
  pinMode(levelPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(outputPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  int level = analogRead(levelPin);
  // Professional audio uses logarithmic scaling
  float dbLevel = 20 * log10(level / 1023.0);
  int outputLevel = map(level, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
  
  analogWrite(outputPin, outputLevel);
  
  Serial.print("Level: ");
  Serial.print(dbLevel);
  Serial.println(" dB");
  
  delay(50);
