## Notes

This is an excellent value for a multifunctional component tester. The device provides professional-level testing capabilities at a fraction of the cost of traditional LCR meters. The SMD testing capability and data export features make it particularly useful for modern electronics work.

The anti-burn protection and one-button operation make it safe and easy to use, while the color display and component pinout diagrams provide clear, informative results.

## Pinout/Connection Information

### Test Socket Connections

The LCR-P1 uses a Zero Insertion Force (ZIF) socket with the following pin assignments:

- **Pin 1**: Test Point A (left side when facing display)
- **Pin 2**: Test Point B (center)
- **Pin 3**: Test Point C (right side when facing display)

### SMD Test Platform

When using the SMD adapter, components are placed directly on the test platform pads which correspond to the same electrical connections as the ZIF socket pins.

### USB Connection

- **USB Type**: Mini-USB connector on side of device
- **Function**: Data transfer and firmware updates
- **Cable**: Standard Mini-USB cable (not included)

## Circuit Integration Notes

### In-Circuit Testing

- **IMPORTANT**: Always power off circuits before testing components in-circuit
- Can test components with one leg lifted from circuit
- Anti-burn protection helps prevent damage to sensitive components
- Test clips can be used for accessing components without desoldering

### Component Handling

- Use anti-static precautions when handling sensitive components
- Clean component leads before testing for accurate readings
- Store in anti-static environment when not in use

## Technical Specifications

### Measurement Accuracy

- **Resistance**: ±1% + 3 digits (typical)
- **Capacitance**: ±2% + 5 digits (typical)
- **Inductance**: ±3% + 5 digits (typical)
- **Voltage**: ±1% + 2 digits (typical)

### Environmental Specifications

- **Operating Temperature**: 0°C to 40°C
- **Storage Temperature**: -10°C to 60°C
- **Humidity**: 80% RH max (non-condensing)
- **Altitude**: Up to 2000m

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
