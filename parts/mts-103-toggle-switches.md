## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these toggle switches:

- **Motor Control**: Forward/Off/Reverse motor control circuits
- **Electronics Projects**: General purpose switching in hobby projects
- **Control Panels**: Industrial and automotive control applications
- **Audio Equipment**: Input selection and routing switches
- **Power Control**: ON/OFF switching with center-off safety position
- **Automotive**: Dashboard switches and accessory control
- **Marine Applications**: Boat electrical system controls
- **Test Equipment**: Manual switching in test setups
- **Lighting Control**: Multi-way lighting control systems
- **Robotics**: Manual override switches for robotic systems

## Wiring Configuration

### Terminal Identification
- **Terminal 1 (Top)**: First switched output
- **Terminal 2 (Center)**: Common input/output
- **Terminal 3 (Bottom)**: Second switched output

### Common Wiring Examples
- **Motor Reversing**: Center = motor common, Top/Bottom = forward/reverse
- **Power Switching**: Center = power input, Top/Bottom = different outputs
- **Signal Routing**: Center = signal input, Top/Bottom = different destinations

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- Always observe voltage and current ratings for safe operation
- Use appropriate wire gauge for the current being switched
- Ensure proper panel mounting with included hardware
- Center-off position provides safety isolation when needed
- Suitable for both AC and DC applications within ratings
- Screw terminals provide secure wire connections
- Professional appearance suitable for front panel mounting

## Installation

- Drill 5.7mm (0.22") hole in panel
- Insert switch through hole from front
- Secure with included nut and washers from rear
- Connect wires to screw terminals as needed
- Test operation before final installation

## Safety Considerations

- **Voltage Rating**: Never exceed 250V AC or equivalent DC
- **Current Rating**: Do not exceed 3A at 250V AC or 6A at 125V AC
- **Proper Mounting**: Ensure secure panel mounting for safety
- **Wire Gauge**: Use appropriate wire gauge for current load
- **Environmental**: Protect from moisture in outdoor applications
