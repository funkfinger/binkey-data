## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

### Electronics Assembly:
- Small circuit board mounting and spacing
- Sensor module assemblies
- Microcontroller project enclosures
- Precision electronic device construction
- Prototype assemblies

### Specific Applications:
- Arduino and Raspberry Pi accessories
- Small PCB standoff applications
- Delicate electronic assemblies
- Miniature mechanical assemblies
- Educational electronics projects

### General Assembly:
- Small device construction
- Precision instrument assembly
- Hobby electronics projects
- Maker and DIY projects requiring fine hardware

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Standoff Placement**: Install brass standoffs in base material at mounting points
2. **Alignment**: Ensure standoffs align with component mounting holes
3. **Tightening**: Hand-tighten standoffs, then use small hex wrench for final tightening
4. **Component Mounting**: Place component on standoffs and secure with appropriate screws
5. **Torque Control**: Use light torque to avoid stripping small threads

### Best Practices:

- Use appropriate Phillips screwdriver size (#0 or #1) to avoid stripping
- Don't over-tighten small M2.5 components to prevent thread damage
- Ensure proper thread engagement (minimum 1.5x diameter)
- Use anti-static precautions when working with electronic components
- Consider thermal expansion in temperature-varying environments

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Small Size**: M2.5 is smaller than M3, requiring more delicate handling
- **Material Benefits**: Brass provides excellent electrical conductivity
- **Corrosion Resistance**: 304 stainless steel screws resist rust and corrosion
- **Thread Engagement**: Minimum 3.75mm thread engagement recommended for M2.5
- **Installation Tools**: Small Phillips screwdrivers and hex wrenches required
- **Torque Limitations**: Lower torque specifications due to smaller thread size
- **Precision**: Manufactured to tight tolerances for smooth operation
- **Electrical Properties**: Brass standoffs provide good grounding connection
