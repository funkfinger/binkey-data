- **Brand**: Various manufacturers
- **Model**: 15mm Round Adhesive Rubber Bumpers
- **Package**: Individual pieces
- **Quantity**: 20+ pieces
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $8-12

## Description

These 15mm diameter round adhesive rubber bumpers are perfect for providing consistent surface protection and vibration dampening across a wide range of applications. The standardized 15mm size makes them ideal for electronics projects, furniture protection, and equipment feet where uniform appearance and performance are important. Each bumper features a strong adhesive backing for permanent installation and durable rubber construction for long-lasting performance.

## Specifications

### Physical Characteristics

- **Diameter**: 15mm (0.59 inches) exactly
- **Material**: Durable rubber compound
- **Adhesive**: Strong permanent adhesive backing
- **Color**: Typically black rubber
- **Thickness**: Varies (typically 3-8mm depending on profile)
- **Profile**: Round/cylindrical or hemispherical
- **Surface**: Textured or smooth finish
- **Backing**: Peel-off adhesive liner

### Dimensional Details

- **Contact Area**: ~177 square mm (15mm diameter circle)
- **Load Distribution**: Even across circular contact patch
- **Height Options**: May include different thickness variants
- **Edge Profile**: Rounded or beveled edges for smooth contact

**Visual Description**: These round rubber bumpers are uniformly sized at 15mm diameter, typically appearing as black rubber discs with a textured or smooth top surface. The adhesive backing is usually covered with a clear or white peel-off liner. When viewed from the side, they show a low profile with rounded edges, designed to provide cushioning while maintaining a professional appearance.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Electronics enclosure feet (consistent 15mm spacing)
- Computer and laptop protective pads
- Small appliance feet and bumpers
- Project case standoffs and feet
- Furniture drawer and door bumpers
- Equipment vibration isolation
- Surface protection for delicate finishes
- Non-slip pads for small devices
- Cabinet and furniture leg protection
- Workshop tool and equipment feet

## Installation Instructions

### Basic Installation:

1. **Surface Preparation**: Clean surface with isopropyl alcohol
2. **Positioning**: Mark 15mm centers for consistent spacing
3. **Application**: Remove backing liner and press firmly
4. **Pressure**: Apply firm pressure for 15-20 seconds
5. **Curing**: Allow 24 hours for full adhesive strength

### Spacing Guidelines:

- **Small Devices**: 4 bumpers at corners (rectangular pattern)
- **Medium Equipment**: 6-8 bumpers for stability
- **Large Items**: Space every 100-150mm for even support
- **Weight Distribution**: Consider load per bumper (typically 2-5kg each)

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Load Capacity**: Typically 2-5kg per bumper depending on thickness
- **Temperature Range**: -10°C to +60°C for most rubber compounds
- **Adhesive Strength**: Permanent bond on clean, smooth surfaces
- **Durometer**: Medium hardness for balance of cushioning and stability
- **Compression**: Minimal compression under normal loads
- **Removal**: May require heat and adhesive remover
- **Surface Types**: Best on metal, plastic, glass, and painted surfaces
- **Moisture Resistance**: Good for indoor humid environments
- **Replacement**: Individual replacement possible due to standard size

## Notes

These 15mm round adhesive rubber bumpers are excellent for applications requiring consistent size and professional appearance. The standardized diameter makes them perfect for electronics projects where uniform spacing and appearance are important. Having 20+ pieces provides plenty for multiple projects or allows for consistent bumper replacement across similar devices. The round shape distributes loads evenly and provides good stability while the 15mm size is large enough for meaningful vibration dampening yet small enough to be unobtrusive. Perfect for electronics makers, furniture builders, and anyone needing reliable surface protection with a clean, professional look.
