## Pinout

The 9-pin socket configuration matches the IN-18 nixie tube pinout:

- **Pin 1-8**: Individual digit cathodes (0-7 or similar arrangement)
- **Pin 9**: Common anode or additional cathode
- **Pin Layout**: Linear or slightly staggered arrangement

_Note: Always verify exact pinout with tube datasheet and socket documentation before use._

## Applications

Common uses for IN-18 nixie tube sockets:

- Nixie clock construction and assembly
- IN-18 tube replacement and maintenance
- Vintage electronics restoration projects
- Educational nixie tube demonstrations
- Custom nixie display projects
- Prototyping nixie-based circuits

## Installation Notes

### PCB Mounting
- Use appropriate hole spacing for socket pins
- Ensure adequate clearance for tube insertion/removal
- Consider high voltage spacing requirements between traces
- Use thick PCB material for mechanical stability with large tubes

### Safety Considerations
- Ensure socket rating exceeds nixie operating voltage (~170V)
- Maintain proper high voltage spacing on PCB layout
- Use appropriate current limiting resistors in circuit
- Follow electrical safety guidelines for high voltage work

## Technical Notes

Important considerations for IN-18 tube sockets:

- Socket must be rated for high voltage nixie operation (170V+)
- Ceramic construction preferred for high voltage insulation
- Ensure mechanical compatibility with IN-18 tube pin arrangement
- Consider tube insertion/removal forces in socket selection
- Verify pin contact reliability for long-term operation
- Socket should provide secure tube retention without excessive force

## Compatibility

These sockets are specifically designed for:
- **IN-18 nixie tubes**: Primary compatibility
- **Similar 9-pin nixie tubes**: May be compatible with other tubes using similar pinout
- **High voltage circuits**: Suitable for nixie tube operating voltages
- **PCB integration**: Standard through-hole mounting for easy PCB integration

## Notes

These IN-18 nixie tube sockets are essential components for any project using IN-18 nixie tubes. The ceramic construction provides excellent high voltage insulation and heat resistance required for nixie tube operation. Having 8 sockets provides sufficient quantity for multi-digit nixie clock projects or allows for spares during prototyping. Always verify socket pinout matches your specific IN-18 tubes before final assembly, as there can be variations in pin arrangements between different manufacturers or production runs.
