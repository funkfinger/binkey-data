### Specific Component Applications:
- **Motherboard Installation**: Standoffs provide proper spacing and grounding
- **Circuit Boards**: Secure mounting with electrical isolation
- **Multi-layer Assemblies**: Spacing between stacked components
- **Enclosure Mounting**: Secure attachment to cases and housings

## Installation Guidelines

### Motherboard Installation:

1. **Standoff Placement**: Install brass standoffs in case at motherboard mounting points
2. **Alignment**: Ensure standoffs align with motherboard mounting holes
3. **Tightening**: Hand-tighten standoffs, then use hex wrench for final tightening
4. **Motherboard Mounting**: Place motherboard on standoffs and secure with appropriate screws
5. **Grounding**: Ensure proper electrical connection through brass standoffs

### Circuit Board Mounting:

1. **Hole Preparation**: Verify mounting hole size matches M3 clearance
2. **Standoff Selection**: Choose appropriate standoff height for application
3. **Installation**: Install standoffs in base material or enclosure
4. **Board Mounting**: Secure circuit board with appropriate length screws
5. **Clearance**: Ensure adequate clearance for components and connections

## Organization and Storage

### Bin 54 Organization (6 Sections):

The 320 pieces are organized across 6 sections within Bin 54, likely arranged by:
- **Section A**: M3 x 6mm brass standoffs
- **Section B**: M3 x 6mm screws
- **Section C**: M3 x 10mm screws
- **Section D**: M3 x 15mm screws
- **Section E**: M3 x 20mm screws
- **Section F**: M3 hex nuts and washers

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Material Benefits**: Brass provides excellent electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance
- **Standoff Function**: Creates proper spacing and prevents motherboard short circuits
- **Thread Compatibility**: All components use standard M3x0.5mm metric threading
- **Installation Tools**: Hex wrenches, pliers, or standoff installation tools recommended
- **Torque Control**: Don't over-tighten brass components to avoid thread damage
- **Electrical Properties**: Brass standoffs provide good grounding connection
- **Length Selection**: Choose screw length based on total assembly thickness
- **Clearance**: Ensure adequate clearance around standoffs for components
