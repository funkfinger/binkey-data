## Pinout

The IN-18 typically uses an 11-pin base configuration:

- **Common Cathode**: Shared cathode connection for all digits
- **Digit Anodes**: Individual anode pins for digits 0 through 9
- **Pin Assignment**: Exact pinout may vary by manufacturer batch

_Note: Always verify pinout with tube tester or datasheet before use, as Soviet-era tubes may have manufacturing variations._

## Applications

Common uses for IN-18 nixie tubes:

- Large nixie clocks for prominent display
- Vintage-style digital counters and timers
- Retro electronics projects and displays
- Educational demonstrations of tube technology
- Art installations requiring large glowing numbers
- Replacement tubes for vintage Soviet equipment

## Circuit Requirements

### Power Supply

- **High Voltage**: Requires ~170V DC regulated supply
- **Current Limiting**: Use appropriate current limiting resistors (~100kÎ© typical)
- **Regulation**: Stable voltage regulation important for consistent brightness

### Driving Circuit

- **Decoder**: BCD to decimal decoder (like K155ID1 or 74141)
- **Current Limiting**: Individual current limiting resistors for each digit
- **Switching**: High voltage switching capability required

## Technical Notes

Important considerations for IN-18 tubes:

- Requires high voltage power supply (~170V DC)
- Current limiting resistors essential to prevent tube damage
- Socket required for proper mounting and connections
- Tube warm-up time may be needed for stable operation
- Handle with care due to glass construction and high voltages
- Vintage tubes may have varying characteristics between units

## Safety Considerations

**HIGH VOLTAGE WARNING**: These tubes operate at 170V DC which can be dangerous:

- Always use proper high voltage safety practices
- Ensure power is disconnected before handling
- Use appropriate current limiting to prevent tube damage
- Proper enclosure required to prevent accidental contact
- Follow all electrical safety guidelines when working with high voltage
