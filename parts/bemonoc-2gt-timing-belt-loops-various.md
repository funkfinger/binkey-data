## Pinout/Connection Information

### Pulley Compatibility
- **GT2 Pulleys**: Designed specifically for 2GT/GT2 timing pulleys
- **Tooth Count**: Compatible with 16T, 20T, 36T, 60T GT2 pulleys
- **Bore Sizes**: Works with 3mm, 5mm, 8mm standard bore pulleys
- **Flange Types**: Compatible with flanged and non-flanged pulleys

### Installation Guidelines
```
Closed Loop Installation:
1. Select appropriate loop size for pulley spacing
2. Install over drive and driven pulleys
3. Ensure proper tension (moderate, not excessive)
4. Check pulley alignment for even belt tracking
5. Verify smooth operation through full rotation
6. No belt joining required - pre-formed loops
```

### Sizing Calculation
```
Belt Length = (Pulley Spacing × 2) + (Pulley Circumferences)
Example: For 20T pulleys spaced 50mm apart:
- Pulley circumference: 20T × 2mm = 40mm
- Required length: (50 × 2) + 40 = 140mm
- Select nearest available size (e.g., 158mm)
```
