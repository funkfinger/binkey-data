# Assorted Small Size Heat Shrink Tubing Kit

## Details

- **Location**: Cabinet-3, Bin 25
- **Category**: Tools & Supplies — Heat Shrink Tubing
- **Brand/Manufacturer**: Various
- **Model**: Assorted small-diameter heat shrink tubing
- **Quantity**: Various (assorted kit)
- **Status**: Available
- **Product URL**: https://a.co/d/4WxfsVu

## Description

This assortment includes various small-diameter heat shrink tubes in multiple colors and sizes (typically 1mm to 6mm pre-shrink). Heat shrink tubing provides electrical insulation, abrasion resistance, and mechanical strain relief for wire terminations and splices. Ideal for harnessing, labeling, and protecting solder joints in electronics projects.

## Specifications

### Material & Properties
- **Material**: Polyolefin (typical)
- **Shrink Ratio**: 2:1 (typical)
- **Operating Temperature**: -55°C to +125°C (typical)
- **Shrink Temperature**: ≥90°C (typical)
- **Dielectric Strength**: High (varies by manufacturer)
- **Flame Retardant**: Often yes (varies)

### Size Range (Typical)
- **Inner Diameter (pre-shrink)**: ~1mm, 2mm, 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 6mm
- **Wall Thickness (post-shrink)**: Varies by size
- **Colors**: Mixed (black, red, yellow, blue, green, white)

## Applications

- Insulating solder joints and exposed conductors
- Strain relief for wire terminations
- Bundling and harnessing small wire groups
- Color coding and labeling connections
- Protecting sensor and cable splices
- Reinforcing connector backshells

## Usage Notes

- Choose tubing with pre-shrink ID 20–50% larger than the object to cover
- Use a heat gun for controlled, even shrinking (avoid open flame when possible)
- Verify temperature limits for sensitive components nearby
- For outdoor use, consider adhesive-lined (dual-wall) variants for sealing

## Notes

This kit focuses on smaller diameters commonly used for signal wires and small-gauge leads in electronics. For larger cable diameters or waterproofing, stock adhesive-lined and larger-diameter tubing separately.
