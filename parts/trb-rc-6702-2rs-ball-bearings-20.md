**Visual Description**: These precision ball bearings appear as small, compact units with the characteristic 15x21x4mm dimensions. The blue rubber seals are visible on both sides, providing a professional appearance while indicating the ABEC 3 steel construction. The bearings have a smooth, precision-machined finish typical of quality RC components.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- RC car wheel hubs and axles
- High-speed RC vehicle drivetrains
- Precision mechanical assemblies
- Small motor applications
- RC helicopter rotor systems
- Drone gimbal mechanisms
- Model aircraft control surfaces
- Precision instrumentation
- Small machinery and equipment
- Hobby and maker projects requiring precision rotation

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed and Load Ratings:
- **Maximum RPM**: High-speed capability suitable for RC applications
- **Radial Load**: Excellent radial load capacity for size
- **Axial Load**: Limited axial load capacity (typical for ball bearings)
- **Operating Temperature**: Standard range for RC applications
- **Noise Level**: Low noise operation due to precision construction

### Seal Performance:
- **Contamination Protection**: Excellent protection from dirt and debris
- **Moisture Resistance**: Good resistance to water and humidity
- **Lubrication Retention**: Seals help maintain internal lubrication
- **Friction**: Slightly higher friction than open bearings but acceptable for most applications

## Installation and Maintenance

### Installation Guidelines:

1. **Bearing Selection**: Verify 15x21x4mm dimensions match application requirements
2. **Cleaning**: Clean bearing seat and shaft thoroughly before installation
3. **Installation**: Press bearing into place using proper tools (avoid hammering)
4. **Alignment**: Ensure bearing is properly seated and aligned
5. **Clearance**: Verify adequate clearance for bearing operation
6. **Testing**: Check for smooth rotation and proper fit

### Maintenance Tips:

- **Inspection**: Periodically check for wear, damage, or contamination
- **Cleaning**: Clean external surfaces but avoid removing seals
- **Lubrication**: Sealed bearings typically don't require additional lubrication
- **Replacement**: Replace when rough operation or excessive play develops
- **Storage**: Store in clean, dry environment to prevent corrosion

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Precision Grade**: ABEC 3 provides good balance of precision and cost for RC applications
- **Seal Type**: 2RS seals provide excellent protection but slightly increase friction
- **Load Direction**: Primarily designed for radial loads; limited axial load capacity
- **Speed Limits**: High-speed capability but verify against specific application requirements
- **Temperature Range**: Suitable for typical RC operating temperatures
- **Mounting**: Use proper installation tools to avoid bearing damage
- **Preload**: Minimal preload required for most RC applications
- **Replacement**: Always replace bearings in pairs when possible for balanced performance
