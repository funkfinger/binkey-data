## Image

_Image needed: 8-position green terminal block showing screw terminals and PCB mounting pins._

**Visual Description**: This terminal block appears as a green plastic housing with 8 individual screw terminals arranged in a row. Each terminal has a screw for wire clamping and the block has through-hole pins underneath for PCB mounting. The 0.2" spacing between terminals is clearly visible, and wire entry is from the horizontal side.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Industrial control panel wiring
- Power distribution in electronics
- Signal connection interfaces
- Motor control circuits
- Sensor and actuator connections
- Test equipment interfaces
- Prototype and development boards
- Automation system wiring
- HVAC control systems
- Lighting control applications

## Circuit Examples

### Basic Power Distribution

```
Terminal Block Connections:
Position 1-2: AC Line Input (L1, L2)
Position 3-4: DC Power Output (+12V, GND)
Position 5-6: Control Signals (Signal, GND)
Position 7-8: Status Outputs (Relay+, Relay-)
```

### PCB Integration

```
PCB Layout Considerations:
- 0.2" (5.08mm) hole spacing
- Through-hole pad diameter: 1.2-1.5mm
- Copper pour clearance around terminals
- Adequate trace width for current rating
- Proper ground plane connections
```

## Installation Instructions

### PCB Mounting:

1. **PCB Preparation**: Ensure holes are properly sized and spaced
2. **Component Placement**: Insert terminal block from component side
3. **Soldering**: Solder all pins from solder side of PCB
4. **Inspection**: Verify all solder joints are complete

### Wire Connections:

1. **Wire Preparation**: Strip wire ends 6-8mm
2. **Terminal Opening**: Loosen screw to open clamp
3. **Wire Insertion**: Insert stripped wire fully into terminal
4. **Clamping**: Tighten screw to secure wire (proper torque)
5. **Testing**: Verify secure connection with gentle pull test

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Torque Specifications**: Follow manufacturer's torque recommendations
- **Wire Stripping**: Proper strip length prevents short circuits
- **Current Derating**: Consider derating for high ambient temperatures
- **PCB Thickness**: Verify compatibility with PCB thickness
- **Spacing Requirements**: Allow clearance for wire bending radius
- **Maintenance**: Periodic inspection and re-tightening may be needed
- **Safety**: Always de-energize circuits before making connections
- **Standards Compliance**: Verify UL/CE compliance for specific applications

## Notes

These 8-position terminal blocks are essential components for professional electronics projects requiring reliable wire-to-PCB connections. The 0.2" spacing is a standard pitch that's widely compatible with PCB layouts and other terminal block accessories. Having 7 pieces provides flexibility for multiple projects or allows for consistent terminal block usage across similar designs. The screw terminal design ensures serviceable connections that can be easily modified or troubleshot in the field. Perfect for industrial control applications, power distribution, and any project where reliable, high-current connections are needed between external wiring and PCB circuits.
