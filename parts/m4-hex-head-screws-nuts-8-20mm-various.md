- **Brand**: Various manufacturers
- **Model**: M4 Hex Head Cap Screws and Nuts - 8-20mm Lengths
- **Thread Size**: M4 (4mm nominal diameter)
- **Package**: Assorted lengths between 8-20mm
- **Quantity**: Various M4 hex head screws and nuts
- **Status**: Available
- **Price Range**: $10-20

## Description

This collection contains various M4 hex head cap screws and nuts in lengths ranging from 8-20mm. The M4 thread size (4mm nominal diameter) with standard 0.7mm pitch provides strong, reliable fastening for mechanical assemblies, electronics enclosures, and structural applications requiring more strength than smaller M3 fasteners. The hex socket cap head design allows for precise torque control and provides a clean, professional appearance. This length range covers most common M4 applications from short assemblies to medium-depth fastening requirements.

## Specifications

### Thread Specifications

- **Thread Size**: M4 (4mm nominal diameter)
- **Thread Pitch**: 0.7mm (standard coarse pitch for M4)
- **Thread Standard**: ISO metric thread

**Visual Description**: The collection contains cylindrical-headed screws with internal hex sockets in various lengths from 8-20mm, paired with matching hexagonal nuts. The M4 size is noticeably larger than M3, providing increased strength and load capacity. The hex socket design provides precise torque control and professional appearance.

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these components:

- Heavy-duty electronics enclosure assembly
- Mechanical equipment mounting
- Structural assemblies requiring higher strength
- Industrial control panels
- Automotive applications
- Machinery construction
- Prototype and production assemblies
- Furniture and cabinet construction
- Equipment mounting and brackets
- General mechanical fastening requiring M4 strength

## Length-Specific Applications

### 8mm Applications:
- Thin panel assemblies
- Electronics with minimal depth
- Surface mounting applications
- Bracket attachments

### 10-12mm Applications:
- Standard mechanical assemblies
- Electronics enclosures
- Control panel mounting
- Typical structural connections

### 16mm Applications:
- Thicker materials
- Multi-component assemblies
- Extended reach applications
- Heavy-duty mounting

### 20mm Applications:
- Deep assemblies
- Multiple washers or spacers
- Structural connections
- Maximum depth requirements

## Installation Guidelines

### Basic Installation:

1. **Length Selection**: Choose appropriate screw length for total assembly thickness
2. **Clearance Holes**: Drill appropriate clearance holes (4.2-4.5mm typical)
3. **Thread Preparation**: Tap threads if needed (M4x0.7 tap)
4. **Assembly**: Insert screw through all components
5. **Tightening**: Use appropriate hex key size (typically 3mm for M4)
6. **Torque Control**: Apply appropriate torque for material and application

### Best Practices:

- Calculate total assembly thickness before selecting length
- Allow for washers and spacers in length calculations
- Use thread locker for vibration-prone applications
- Consider material compatibility to prevent galvanic corrosion
- Don't over-tighten to avoid thread stripping
- Use appropriate hex key size to prevent socket stripping

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Hex Key Size**: M4 cap screws typically use 3mm hex key
- **Thread Engagement**: Minimum 1.5x diameter (6mm) thread engagement recommended
- **Load Capacity**: Higher load capacity than M3 screws due to larger diameter
- **Torque Specifications**: Higher torque capability than smaller metric screws
- **Strength**: Suitable for structural and heavy-duty applications
- **Material Selection**: Choose appropriate material for environment and load requirements
- **Preload**: Can handle higher preload than smaller diameter screws
- **Clearance**: Ensure adequate clearance for hex key access during installation

## Notes

These M4 hex head cap screws and nuts provide robust fastening solutions for applications requiring more strength than M3 fasteners. The 8-20mm length range covers most common M4 applications from thin panel assemblies to deeper structural connections. The larger M4 size offers increased load capacity and torque handling, making them ideal for heavy-duty mechanical assemblies, industrial equipment, and structural applications. Having various lengths ensures you'll have the right fastener for most M4 applications requiring reliable, high-strength connections. The hex socket design provides precise torque control and professional appearance for both prototype and production work.
