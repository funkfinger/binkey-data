## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these 3-conductor connectors:

- Residential electrical wiring with hot, neutral, and ground
- Light fixture installations with 3-wire configurations
- Junction box wire splicing for multiple circuits
- Electrical panel connections requiring 3 conductors
- Automotive wiring applications with 3-wire harnesses
- Low voltage DC connections with power, ground, and signal
- LED strip and lighting connections with control wires
- Home automation wiring with power and data lines

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- Always ensure all three wires are fully inserted until they contact the back of the connector
- Verify connections by gently tugging on wires after all levers are closed
- Use appropriate wire gauge for the application and current requirements
- Transparent housing allows visual inspection of all three connection points
- All three levers must be fully closed to ensure proper electrical connections
- Can mix solid and stranded wires in the same connector
- Superior to wire nuts for 3-wire connections with different wire gauges
- Ideal for applications where frequent disconnection/reconnection is needed

## Notes

These WAGO 221-413 3-conductor connectors are essential for electrical work requiring three wire connections. They eliminate the complexity and unreliability of trying to twist three wires together with traditional wire nuts. The individual lever operation for each conductor ensures secure connections regardless of wire gauge differences. The transparent housing provides confidence that all three connections are properly made, and the ability to easily disconnect and reconnect individual wires makes troubleshooting and modifications much easier. Highly recommended for any electrical work involving 3-wire configurations.
