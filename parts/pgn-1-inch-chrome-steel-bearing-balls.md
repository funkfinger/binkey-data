- Custom machinery construction
- Educational mechanical engineering demonstrations

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- **Grade G25**: Moderate precision grade suitable for most industrial applications
- **Tolerance**: Exact tolerances depend on manufacturer specifications
- **Hardness**: HRC 60-66 typical for AISI 52100 steel
- **Load Capacity**: High load capacity due to chrome steel construction
- **Temperature Range**: Suitable for normal industrial temperature ranges
- **Lubrication**: Requires appropriate bearing grease or oil
- **Installation**: Handle with clean tools to avoid contamination
- **Storage**: Store in dry environment to prevent corrosion
- **Compatibility**: Verify race dimensions before installation
- **Safety**: Wear safety glasses when handling - balls can roll unexpectedly
