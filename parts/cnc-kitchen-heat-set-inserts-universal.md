## Installation Guide

### Required Tools
- Soldering iron (15-25W recommended)
- Needle-nose pliers or insert installation tool
- Drill bits (3.7mm for M2.5, 4.5mm for M3)

### Installation Process
1. **Drill Hole**: Use specified drill bit size for clean, straight hole
2. **Heat Insert**: Place insert on soldering iron tip
3. **Install**: Gently press heated insert into hole until flush
4. **Cool**: Allow to cool completely before use
5. **Test**: Verify thread engagement with appropriate screw
