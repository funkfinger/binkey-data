## Applications

Common use cases and applications for these momentary toggle switches:

- **Automotive Controls**: Window controls, seat adjustments, mirror positioning
- **Marine Applications**: Winch controls, trim tab adjustments, bilge pump controls
- **Electronics Projects**: Manual pulse generation, temporary circuit activation
- **Control Panels**: Jog controls, manual overrides, test functions
- **Robotics**: Manual positioning controls, emergency stops, mode selection
- **Audio Equipment**: Momentary mute, channel selection, effect triggers
- **Industrial Controls**: Manual valve controls, conveyor jog, equipment testing
- **Model Railways**: Turnout controls, signal activation, accessory control
- **Test Equipment**: Manual trigger switches, calibration controls
- **Security Systems**: Panic buttons, manual alarm triggers

## Wiring Configuration

### Terminal Identification
- **Terminal 1 (Top)**: First momentary output
- **Terminal 2 (Center)**: Common input/output
- **Terminal 3 (Bottom)**: Second momentary output

### Common Wiring Examples
- **Motor Jog Control**: Center = motor common, Top/Bottom = forward/reverse momentary
- **Pulse Generation**: Center = signal input, Top/Bottom = different pulse outputs
- **Manual Override**: Center = control input, Top/Bottom = override functions

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage tips:

- Momentary operation means switch returns to center OFF position automatically
- Ideal for applications requiring spring-return operation
- Waterproof caps provide protection in harsh environments
- Compact size suitable for space-constrained applications
- Screw terminals provide secure wire connections
- Mini form factor perfect for handheld controllers
- Spring mechanism provides tactile feedback

## Installation

- Drill 6mm (0.23") hole in panel
- Insert switch through hole from front
- Secure with included hex nuts and washers from rear
- Connect wires to screw terminals as needed
- Install waterproof cap if environmental protection needed
- Test momentary operation before final installation

## Safety Considerations

- **Voltage Rating**: Never exceed 250V AC or equivalent DC
- **Current Rating**: Do not exceed 2A at 250V AC or 5A at 125V AC
- **Momentary Operation**: Ensure circuit design accounts for spring-return behavior
- **Environmental**: Use waterproof caps in wet or dusty conditions
- **Wire Gauge**: Use appropriate wire gauge for current load

## Included Accessories

Each switch comes with:
- 2 hex nuts for panel mounting
- 1 flat washer
- 1 locking washer
- 1 waterproof cap for environmental protection
