## Description

Kingbright PSA12-11SRWA red alphanumeric LED display with 16-segment configuration for displaying letters, numbers, and symbols. Large 1.2" character display with common anode configuration and high brightness red LEDs.

## Specifications

- **Part Number**: PSA12-11SRWA
- **Character Height**: 1.20" (30.48mm)
- **Segments**: 16-segment alphanumeric
- **Emitting Color**: Red
- **Polarity**: Common Anode
- **Forward Voltage**: 3.6V (typical)
- **Test Current**: 10mA
- **Luminous Intensity**: 28mcd (typical)
- **Wavelength**: 655nm (peak)
- **Power Dissipation**: 75mW (maximum)
- **Package**: 18-DIP (0.800", 20.32mm pitch)
- **Dimensions**: 1.575" H x 1.083" W x 0.463" D (40.00mm x 27.50mm x 11.75mm)

## Features

- **Large 1.2" Character**: Excellent visibility from distance
- **16-Segment Display**: Can display full alphabet, numbers, and symbols
- **High Brightness**: 28mcd luminous intensity
- **Common Anode**: Anode shared, cathodes individual
- **Standard DIP Package**: Easy breadboard and PCB mounting
- **Wide Viewing Angle**: Good visibility from multiple angles
- **Industrial Temperature Range**: Reliable operation

## Pinout

- **Common Anode**: Multiple common anode pins
- **Segment Pins**: Individual pins for each of the 16 segments
- **18-Pin DIP**: Standard dual in-line package

## Applications

- Large numeric displays
- Status indicators
- Industrial control panels
- Test and measurement equipment
- Digital clocks and timers
- Scoreboards and counters
- Point-of-sale displays
- Instrument panels
- Educational demonstrations
- Prototype displays

## Interface Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: Any MCU with sufficient GPIO pins
- **Current Limiting**: Resistors required for each segment
- **Multiplexing**: For multiple displays, consider multiplexing circuit
- **Driver ICs**: Can use segment driver ICs like MAX7219 for easier control
- **Power Supply**: 5V typical with current limiting resistors

## Notes

- Common anode configuration (anodes shared, cathodes individual)
- Requires current limiting resistors for each segment
- Can display A-Z, 0-9, and many special characters
- Large size makes it ideal for applications requiring high visibility
- 16-segment provides better character representation than 14-segment
- Through-hole mounting for easy prototyping and permanent installation
