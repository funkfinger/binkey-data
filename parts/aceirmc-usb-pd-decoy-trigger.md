## Description

The ACEIRMC USB-PD Decoy Trigger is a specialized module designed to interface with USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) chargers and power supplies. It acts as a decoy device that can negotiate with USB-PD sources to trigger specific voltage outputs, making it ideal for powering projects that need higher voltages than the standard 5V USB provides.

This module supports multiple fast charging protocols including Quick Charge (QC), Adaptive Fast Charging (AFC), USB PD 2.0, and USB PD 3.0, allowing it to work with a wide variety of modern USB-C chargers and power adapters.

## Specifications

### Electrical Characteristics

- **Supported Voltages**: 5V, 9V, 12V, 15V, 20V (USB-PD standard)
- **Power Delivery**: Up to 100W (USB PD 3.0 specification)
- **Protocols**: QC (Quick Charge), AFC (Adaptive Fast Charging), USB PD 2.0, USB PD 3.0
- **Interface**: USB Type-C connector

### Physical Characteristics

- **Package**: Small PCB module with integrated Type-C connector
- **Form Factor**: Compact module suitable for embedded applications
- **Operating Temperature**: Standard electronic component range

### Key Features

- Multi-protocol support (QC, AFC, PD 2.0, PD 3.0)
- Automatic voltage negotiation with USB-PD sources
- Decoy trigger functionality for testing and development
- Compatible with USB-C notebook power supplies
- Supports standard USB-PD voltage levels

## Applications

Common use cases and applications for this component:

- USB-PD power supply testing and development
- Triggering higher voltages from USB-C chargers for projects
- Power supply modification and adaptation
- Fast charging protocol compatibility testing
- Notebook power supply interfacing
- DIY power delivery projects

## Technical Notes

Important technical considerations and usage notes:

- Requires compatible USB-PD source (charger/power supply) to function
- Output voltage depends on successful negotiation with the power source
- Not all USB-C chargers support all voltage levels
- Module acts as a trigger/detector, not a voltage regulator
- Proper electrical safety precautions should be taken when working with higher voltages
