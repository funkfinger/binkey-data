## Notes

Perfect for projects requiring individually controllable RGB LEDs. The stick format makes it ideal for creating linear light displays or as building blocks for larger LED arrays. Each LED can display over 16 million colors with smooth dimming capabilities. The single data line interface makes it easy to control from any microcontroller with minimal pin usage. Can be chained with other NeoPixel products to create larger displays.
