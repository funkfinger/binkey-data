## Organization Philosophy

### Bin Numbering

- Each cabinet uses sequential bin numbering (1-44 or 1-50)
- Empty bins are clearly marked as `[[empty]]`
- Bins include descriptive headers indicating contents

### Component Grouping Strategy

- **Cabinet 1**: Individual part files for unique development boards and tools
- **Cabinet 2**: Consolidated files for passive components with multiple values
- **Cabinet 3**: Mixed approach - individual files for complex modules, consolidated for similar components

### Inventory Tracking

- Each component entry includes quantity information
- Wikilinks connect to detailed part specification files
- Regular updates maintain accuracy of populated bin counts

### Cross-References

- Components reference their physical bin locations
- Part files include cabinet and bin location information
- Index files provide category-based component listings
